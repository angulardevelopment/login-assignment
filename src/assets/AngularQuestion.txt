Here is what we have given you
1.	A zip file containing this document and two more files
2.	The two files contains the html for the login page and the home page(login.html and grid.html)


Application
1. THe application is a student management system and we are doing two small part of the application which are 
          a. Login Page
		  b. Students information grid
2. The login page and students information grid html is given in zip file
3. NOTE- SINCE THERE IS NO WEB API WHEREVER DATA IS REQUIRED THE APPROPRIATE LAYER IN ANGULAR WOULD RETURN IT IN VARIABLES AS  LIST OR A VARIABLES
4. Login page has a user name and password text box and a login button. The only user name and password which should work is rammanohar@inncrewin.com and password Inncrewin123. Rest of the logins should fail with error being shown in the UI
5. Once user logs in successfully using above username/password the students information page comes up which is only a grid with following columns
            a. First Name
			b. Last Name
			c. Email address
			d. Age
			
As said in point 3 above, the data will be filled up in the variables in the appropriate layer since API is not there
6. ON clicking a particular row, a new page should open up which will bring in the details of the student to edit in text boxes.THe design can be just a list of text boxes and a Save button. The age should be a date field.
7. On saving it should call the appropriate layer and since no api, that layer should return true and the UI should show success.


Here is what you need to do
1. Create the application
2. Create the components with proper routing
3. Create the pages with html given
4. Bind the data properly and show the data as well as validation and other  things required for angular to bind
5 PLEASE NOTE POINT 3. IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO HARD CODE THE VALUES IN SOME COMPONENTS BUT IN A DIFFERENT APPROPRIATE LAYER. THE CODE WILL BE EVALUATED USING STRUCTURE AS BASE
